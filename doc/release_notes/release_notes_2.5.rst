ACRN v2.5 (Jun 2021) DRAFT
##########################

We are pleased to announce the release of the Project ACRN hypervisor
version 2.5.

ACRN is a flexible, lightweight reference hypervisor that is built with
real-time and safety-criticality in mind. It is optimized to streamline
embedded development through an open-source platform. See the
:ref:`introduction` introduction for more information.

All project ACRN source code is maintained in the
https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor repository and includes
folders for the ACRN hypervisor, the ACRN device model, tools, and
documentation. You can either download this source code as a zip or
tar.gz file (see the `ACRN v2.5 GitHub release page
<https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor/releases/tag/v2.5>`_) or
use Git ``clone`` and ``checkout`` commands::

   git clone https://github.com/projectacrn/acrn-hypervisor
   cd acrn-hypervisor
   git checkout v2.5

The project's online technical documentation is also tagged to
correspond with a specific release: generated v2.5 documents can be
found at https://projectacrn.github.io/2.5/.  Documentation for the
latest under-development branch is found at
https://projectacrn.github.io/latest/.

ACRN v2.5 requires Ubuntu 18.04.  Follow the instructions in the
:ref:`rt_industry_ubuntu_setup` to get started with ACRN.


What's New in v2.5
******************


ACRN Configuration and Build
============================

The following major changes on ACRN configuration and build process have been
integrated into v2.5:

- Change 1
- Change 2

For complete instructions to get started with the new build system, refer to
:ref:`getting-started-building`. For an introduction on the concepts and
workflow of the new configuration mechanism, refer to
:ref:`acrn_configuration_tool`.

Upgrading to v2.5 From Previous Releases
****************************************

We highly recommended that you follow the instructions below to
upgrade to v2.5 from previous ACRN releases.

Generate New Board XML
======================

Board XML files, generated by ACRN board inspector, contain board information
that is essential to build ACRN. Compared to previous versions, ACRN v2.5
extends the schema of board XMLs to summarize board information more
systematically. You must regenerate your board XML file using the new
board inspector when you upgrade to ACRN v2.5.

To use the new board inspector, ensure you have Python >= 3.6 on the target
board and install the ``lxml`` PyPI package. Refer to :ref:`upgrade_python` for
detailed steps to check and upgrade Python version. The ``lxml`` package can be
installed by executing the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo pip3 install lxml

.. note::
   Refer to :ref:`acrn_config_workflow` for a complete list of tools required to
   run the board inspector.

With the prerequisites, copying the entire board inspector folder from
``misc/config_tools/board_inspector`` to the target board, ``cd`` to that
directory on the target, and run the tool using::

  sudo python3 cli.py <my_board_name>

This will generate ``<my_board_name>.xml`` under the current working directory.

Add New Configuration Options
=============================

In v2.5, the following elements are added to scenario XMLs:

 - :option:`hv.FEATURES.NVMX_ENABLED`
 - :option:`vm.PTM`

The following element is renamed:

 - :option:`hv.FEATURES.SSRAM.SSRAM_ENABLED` (was ``hv.FEATURES.PSRAM.PSRAM_ENABLED`` in v2.4)

Constraints on values of the following element is changed:

 - :option:`vm.guest_flags.guest_flag` no longer accepts an empty text. For VMs
   without any guest flag set, a ``0`` should be given.
